# Final Thoughts

This was a fun a code test, so fun I surpassed my typical four hour timebox. I do want to call out a few things... 1) I used Typescript, but missed a few type definitions due to time constraints, 2) I would have liked to cleanup my CSS if I had more time, and 3) If I had more time I would have also tested the content of each element.
